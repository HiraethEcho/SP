The first is to give a tutorial introduction to the Sarkisov program, a 3-dimensional generalization of Castelnuovo-N\textbackslash "other Theorem ``untwisting" birational maps between Mori fiber spaces, which was recently established by Corti after Sarkisov and Reid. The second is an attempt to give a logarithmic generalization of the program, introducing the notion of the Sarkisov relation. We give a simple description of the structure of the program and clarify the mechanism of termination connected to the boundedness conjecture of (log) Q-Fano n-folds by Borisov.},

We then show that the BorisovAlexeev-Borisov conjecture holds, that is, given a natural number d and a positive real number \k{o}, the set of Fano varieties of dimension d with \k{o}-log canonical singularities forms a bounded family. This implies that birational automorphism groups of rationally connected varieties are Jordan which in particular answers a question of Serre. Next we show that if the log canonical threshold of the anti-canonical system of a Fano variety is at most one, then it is computed by some divisor, answering a question of Tian in this case.},
