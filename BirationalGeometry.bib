No history, no exceptional divisors, and no logarithmic structures are necessary to carry this out; the steps are explicit geometric operations requiring no choices; and the resulting algorithm is efficient.

For example, it implies that if N is a big Weil divisor (not necessarily nef) on a klt Calabi-Yau variety of dimension d, then the linear system |mN | defines a birational map for some natural number m depending only on d. It also gives new proofs of some known results, for example, if X is an -lc Fano variety of dimension d then taking N = -KX we recover birationality of | - mKX | for bounded m.},

Under the assumption that the boundary BS is irreducible, we obtain an algorithm to factorize any automorphism of V into a sequence of simple links. This factorization lies in the framework of the log Mori theory, with the property that all the blow-ups and contractions involved in the process occur on the boundary. When the completion S is smooth, we obtain a description of the automorphisms of V which is reminiscent of a presentation by generators and relations except that the ``generators'' are no longer automorphisms. They are instead isomorphisms between different models of V preserving certain rational fibrations. This description enables one to define normal forms of automorphisms and leads in particular to a natural generalization of the usual notions of affine and Jonqui\`eres automorphisms of the affine plane. When V is affine, we show however that except for a finite family of surfaces including the affine plane, the group generated by these affine and Jonqui\`eres automorphisms, which we call the tame group of V , is a proper subgroup of Aut(V ).},

Nevertheless Abramovich, Temkin, and Wlodarczyk, [ATW], have varied existing technology to obtain an even shorter proof of principalisation, I.f, in the geometric case. Excellent patching is more technical than varieties over a field, and whence easier geometric arguments are pointed out when they exist.},

The log del Pezzo surfaces of index two are shown to be constructed from data (X, E, {$\increment$}) called fundamental triplets consisting of a non-singular rational surface X, a simple normal crossing divisor E of X, and an effective Cartier divisor {$\increment$} of E satisfying a suitable condition. A geometric classification of the fundamental triplets gives a classification of the log del Pezzo surfaces of index two. As a result, any log del Pezzo surface of index two can be described explicitly as a subvariety of a weighted projective space or of the product of two weighted projective spaces. This classification does not use the theory of K3 lattices, which is essential for the classification by Alexeev\textendash Nikulin [3]. The comparison between two classifications is also discussed.},
