//take C containing all such divisors => take C to be the set consisting of all exceptional divisors E of discrepancy a(E; X, B) ⩽ 0

Mori fibre spaces as outputs of (KW + BW )-MMP on W . --- why not say 
"are two MMP-related Mori fibre spaces" ?

//then (X′, B′ + 1/μ H′) is a weak log canonical model. -- should it be (X′, B′ + μ H′)? 
or is the previous 1/μ wrong? I think BM assume  
μ′ (KX′ + B′) + f ′∗A′ is very ample and so 
 we can pick a general element in this linear series 

//Therefore we expect that X-->X′ is the output of a certain MMP.

then we let c>0 be the supremum of all numbers such that 

(1) KX + B + cH is non-positive over S, and --- do you mean -(KX + B + cH) is nef over S? or do you mean KX + B + cH is non-positive for X-->X'?

(2) KX + B + cH is log canonical (θ-canonical).
I am not sure what θ-canonical is here....maybe say (or more generally, θ-canonical, see below)

Then we construct the Sarkisov link as follows:

(1) is hard to follow. Do you mean something like: 
(1) If KX + B + cH is klt, then KX + B + cH is "non-positive over S" and we can find a contraction S->T with \rho (S/T)=1. We then run an MMP for X over T, and obtain a Sarkisov link of type III or IV? 

I find the switching from X to X_i confusing. 

(2) If KX + B + cH is not klt, then consider a divisorial extraction p : Z → X corresponding to a divisor of discrepancy -1. 
Then ρ(Z/S) = 2 and we run an MMP for Z over S, and obtain a Sarkisov link of type I or II.

then H if f -ample  => then H is f -ample

We run (KW + BW + 1/λ HW )-MMP on W over X ==> 
We run the (KW + BW + 1/λ HW )-MMP over X 

of (W, BW + 1/λ HW ) over X ==> 
for (W, BW + 1/λ HW ) over X 

Then we run the (KY + BY )-MMP over X

(Please look for other places where the article "the" is missing)

(1) We only need to show 

be a common resolution 

are contractions of the same numerical curve class, thus
the two log Mori fibre spaces are isomorphic. 

Suppose f is the contraction 
of a (KX + B)-negative extremal ray 

(see [Cor95, 5.4.2] for the details). 

we can run the (KX + B + 1/μ H)-MMP on X
with scaling of some ample divisor. 
Is this mmp over T? 

There are the following cases: 

the first non-flip contraction is a divisorial contraction 
p : Z → X1, which is then followed by a log Mori fibre space 

(b) (c) ....the first non-flip 

(d) the (KX + B + 1/μ H)-MMP

We expect that there are finitely many weak log canonical models

be two different log Mori fibre spaces which are outputs of a (KW + BW )-MMP.

Dear Professor Hacon, 

The reference [Hac12] we quote in the paper is actually your paper, Chapter 13 https://www.math.utah.edu/~hacon/MMP.pdf 

Yanze Wang uses a software of reference shows the paper is published on Wiadomo ́sci Matematyczne,
48(2):49, June 2012. But I checked mathscinet today. It is a mistake. My apologies! I attached the new version of the note. 

Our original plan for the Sarkisov program is to study some conjectures of generators of automorphism group of affine space A^3. For example, it is expected automorphism of A^3 is not generated by linear and triangular transformations by algebraists. In explicit computations, we need to resolve the birational map of P^3. Unlike the surface case, I and my student get stuck on how to resolve a birational map of P^3. 

I saw at the end of your paper with McKernan. You also mentioned Sarkisov program can apply to auto of affine spaces. Any suggestions or comments are appreciated!

主题: Shokurov 70 birthday
Dear Yifei, 

I hope you have a nice summer! 

We are editing a volume for Shokurov 70 birthday conference, and we are wondering whether you are interested to contribute an article.  
Currently we plan to publish the volume in the series of LMS Lecture Notes. The page limit is 25 pages, and the deadline is the end of this year.  

Looking forward to hearing from you! 
Chenyang 
Also on behalf of Christopher
